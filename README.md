# ProductBookRainfallAnalyzer

This Python code accomplishes three tasks sequentially:

1. **Task 1**: It asks the user for the number of products to purchase within a range of 1 to 100. After validating the input, it calculates the total cost and average cost for the entered product costs, displaying the results.

2. **Task 2**: It defines a function `funBook` that calculates the average number of pages for a given number of books. It prompts the user for the number of pages for each book, calculates the average, and displays the result for 5 books.

3. **Task 3**: It asks the user for the number of days and validates it within a range of 1 to 10. Then, it prompts the user for the daily rainfall and counts the days with rainfall greater than 2 inches. The code displays the count of such days.
